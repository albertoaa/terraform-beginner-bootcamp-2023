This project is going to utilize semantic versioning for it's tagging.
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

The general format would be as follows.
Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the:

- **MAJOR** ex: `1.0.1`
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
